Public Code! campaign aims to set Free Software as the standard for publicly financed software. It has been started in autumn 2017 with an open letter which has been signed 12 individuals and 206 organisations. The campaign raises awareness of the importance of licencing decisions and helps public administrations gain full control of their digital infrastructure in order to establish trustworthy systems.
The campaign is lead by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE).</description></item><item><title>Open Letter</title><link>https://publiccode.eu/openletter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://publiccode.eu/openletter/</guid><description>Publicly funded software has to be Free and Open Source Software. While there are plenty of good reasons for this, many politicians don&amp;rsquo;t know about them yet.
Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.
